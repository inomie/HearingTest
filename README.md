# HearingTest
## Description
This is part of my exam work for university. The purpose of this project is to create an Android mobile application to perform a standard audiometry and a specific psychoacoustic (temporal masking) to measure the user’s hearing profile and the hidden hearing loss. The application performs these tests over Bluetooth communication with a specific headphone (Sony WH-1000X M3). The user is responding to the sound by pressing or releasing a touch button on the phone screen. The application can send the results over Bluetooth to headphones over serial communication (SPP profile). The test result will then be used for tuning the sound coding parameters in the connected headphones according to the user’s individual hearing profile.
